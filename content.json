      "full_text": "Abstract: Pineoblastoma is a grade IV tumor that forms in the pineal gland of the brain in individuals between the ages of 1-20. Current treatments for pineoblastoma involve surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, which can have debilitating aftereffects. Pineoblastoma can be linked to mutations in genes like DICER1 and DROSHA, which are involved in micro RNA (miRNA) processing. Based on the literature review findings I have stated above, this article describes current treatments for pineoblastoma and a novel CRISPR-Cas9n-based genetic therapy to treat pineoblastoma without invasive procedures. This is done through a literature review first to determine the causes behind pineoblastoma, diagnosis of it, and usage of CRISPR-Cas9 in brain tumor research and later through a treatment design for pineoblastoma based on these findings. First, CRISPR, Cas9n, and the guide RNA (gRNA) will be added into an hCMV viral vector as a plasmid with replicative abilities silenced. The hCMV vector with these components will be injected into the posterior choroidal artery.  Upon entry into the cell, the Cas9n will initiate single strand breaks in DROSHA and DICER1 genes of pinealocytes to cut out the mutated copy and put in a new copy. Once this occurs, the tumors will stop progressing because DROSHA and DICER1 will produce miRNA and siRNA needed to silence the transcription of genes with reduced aftereffects.",
